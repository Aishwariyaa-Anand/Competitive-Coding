# Rotate List

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.


### Example 1:
![rotate1](https://github.com/Aishwariyaa-Anand/Competitive-Coding/assets/124241367/3aaf6330-0fc5-4cb5-9180-a6a14bf38d49)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```


### Example 2:
![roate2](https://github.com/Aishwariyaa-Anand/Competitive-Coding/assets/124241367/9e7cb9c5-5766-4cad-885f-b3110733c410)

```
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
0 <= k <= 2 * 109
